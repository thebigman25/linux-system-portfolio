# Systems Engineering & Linux Portfolio
> A professional repository of production-grade systems, automation, and infrastructure projects.

## 1. Overview
This portfolio serves as a centralized source-of-truth for my engineering work. It demonstrates a foundational commitment to **Linux-centric systems**, focusing on reliability, reproducibility, and security. Each project included here solves a specific technical challenge, ranging from low-level shell automation to complex backend architectures.

---

## 2. Skills Demonstrated
Instead of just a list of tools, this portfolio validates competency in the following domains:

* **Linux Systems**: User/permission management, Systemd services, process/log management.
* **Automation**: Bash scripting, Cron jobs, and Python-driven CLI utilities.
* **Networking**: TCP/IP configuration, DNS, reverse proxies, and firewall management.
* **Programming**: Scripting (Python) and Compiled (C/Rust/Go) implementations.
* **Infrastructure & DevOps**: Containerization (Docker), CI/CD pipelines, and IaC (Ansible).
* **Security**: Secret management, TLS/SSL handling, and vulnerability scanning.

---

## 3. Portfolio Structure
* `/projects/`: Individual engineering projects with dedicated documentation.
* `/templates/`: Standardized documentation and architecture templates.
* `/docs/`: Global standards, conventions, and setup instructions.
* `/scripts/`: Repository maintenance and project scaffolding tools.
* `/meta/`: Progress tracking, retrospectives, and the project roadmap.

## 5. Standards & Practices
I treat this portfolio as a production environment:
* **Documentation**: Every project follows the [Architecture Decision Record (ADR)](./templates/) format.
* **Commits**: Adherence to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
* **Security**: Zero-tolerance for hardcoded secrets; environment-based configuration only.

## 6. How to Use This Repository
Navigate to the `/projects/` directory to explore specific builds. Each project includes a `README.md` with:
1. A clear problem statement.
2. Installation and usage instructions.
3. Architecture diagrams located in `/assets/`.
